## TODOS


- Ulrik: Creating accounts, keeping history, win/loss ratio, main menu, gameboard size, ball speed, randomness of angle.
- Jakob: Possibility of adding 3rd and fourth player with current map set up so that they join in next game (ball lost).
- Next: Authenticating when logging in? Security and authentication lecture. Two-factor authentication?
- Random player joining (when waiting in some lobby)?
- re-ask for password upon failed loggin
Possibly? DB, adding stuff monotonically (blockchain stuff).

DB for userstats is handled server side.

Handling disconnect?
Handling when people leave.

Handshake back and forth.
